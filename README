Handin: This is my final handin.

Design Choices:
        To fill in the findLowestCostSeam() method, I made 2 helper methods: getImportance()
        and getCostDirs(). getImportance() takes in 4 integers: the row and column value of
        the current pixel and the row and column value of a neighbor pixel. It returns the
        importance value of the current pixel. getCostDirs() takes in the row and column value
        of the current cell and a 2D array of integers. It returns a 1D array that contains a cost value
        and a direction value of the current cell. This program is structured by helper methods that help condense repeated
        code and clean up the findLowestCostSeam() method. At first, there was two separate
        helper methods for getting the cost value and the direction value; however, they
        use many of the same variables so it would be more efficient to combine them into
        one method.
